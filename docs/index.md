## Multiversity
The meaning of Multiversity is a large university with many different departments. We hope this resource becomes a collection of all the resources useful for Hackers and Developers of various Blockchains to learn, develop and contribute.


## Table of Contents
Blockchains are revolutionary technologies that allow for secure, distributed, decentralized information storage. Blockchains disrupt the finance industry via DeFi, governance via DAOs, and collectibles via NFTs. Over the past few years, the blockchain has taken the engineering landscape by storm. However, due to the relative newness of blockchain compared to traditional technologies, its use is still hindered by speculation, confusion, uncertainty, and risk.

In this resource, you will take a holistic look at security, from the theoretical foundations of the blockchain and smart contracts to finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

First, this course will give you the prerequisites to understand blockchain and smart contracts' architecture and major components. Then, it takes you through creating and setting up a development and testing environment allowing you to efficiently build, deploy and debug smart contracts on the local testnet. You will also get to learn how to find vulnerabilities and exploit vulnerabilities in the local testing environment.

Some of the skills and techniques you will learn are:
- How to interact with and get data from public blockchains
- How to write smart contracts in  Solidity
- How to find vulnerabilities in smart contract
- How to test and exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts
