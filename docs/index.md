## Multiversity
Multiversity is a vast open repository of knowledge. Our aim is to create a comprehensive resource hub for Hackers and Developers involved in various Blockchains, fostering learning, development, and contribution.


## Introduction

Unless youâ€™re living under a rock, you would have heard of blockchain and its capabilities in the disruption of multiple industries including finance, asset ownership, governance, supply chain and much much more. 

Despite blockchain's engineering dominance, blockchain development lacks the safety, security, integrity, and ethics prevalent in other industries. 
These resources promise a holistic look at security from the theoretical foundations to the practical applications in finding and exploiting vulnerabilities across the blockchain landscape. 

Whether youâ€™re a student, novice or a professional, thereâ€™s something in it for you! 
And, whatâ€™s better? You can contribute to the ever-growing resources to help spread the knowledge of blockchain security to others.  

You can

- Learn the prerequisites to understand blockchain and smart contracts' architecture and major components. 
- Create and setup a development and testing environment allowing you to efficiently build, deploy and debug smart contracts on the local testnet. 
- Learn how to find vulnerabilities and exploit vulnerabilities in the local testing environment.
- Understand interaction with and retrieve data from public blockchains. 
- Learn to write smart contracts in Solidity. 
- Learn the ways to find vulnerabilities in smart contract. 
- Learn testing and exploiting vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
